# Animations of Quasi-periodic Lensing of Starlight (QPLS)

This page contains the animations of four examples of QPLS demonstrated in the paper (PAPER LINK). A star of radius $10 R_{\odot}$ is lensed by the supermmassive black hole binary (SMBHB) in the host galaxy quasi-periodically. We demonstrate 4 examples of different initial conditions for the SMBHB lens: (1) Quasi-circular SMBHB in the pulsa timing array (PTA) band merging in 13 years, (2) Quasi-circular SMBHB in the LISA band $7.5\cdot10^5$ years prior to merger. (3) Eccentric SMBHB in the LISA band 11 years prior to merger. (4) Highly eccentric SMBHB in the LISA band 1.2 year prior to merger. In all four examples. we show the orbits of the SMBHB, the evolution of the critical curves and images, the evolution of the caustic curves with respect to the source star (assumed to be static), and an animated light curve of the lensing magnification. The host galaxy of the sources are assumed to be at redshift $z=0.5$. The animated light curves correpond to the light curve plots in Figure 2 and Figure 3 of the paper. The 4 animations can be downloaded from the repository. The light curves are produced with the Binary Lens Amplification of STarlight (BLAST) code, which will be made public in the future.
